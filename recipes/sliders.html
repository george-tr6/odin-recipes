        <li><strong>Hawaiian sweet dinner rolls:</strong> Like so many delicious slider recipes, these mini sandwiches start with a package of Hawaiian sweet dinner rolls. </li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Shredded Monterey Jack cheese lends creaminess and bold flavor. </li>
        <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> This is a great way to use leftover cooked chicken breast. </li>
        <li><strong>Hot sauce:</strong> Heat things up with cayenne pepper hot sauce, such as Frankâ€™s. </li>
        <li><strong>Ranch dressing:</strong> Use store-bought ranch dressing or make your own at home. </li>
        <li><strong>Ranch mix:</strong> Use store-bought dry ranch mix or make your own at home. </li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Brush the sliders with melted butter before cooking. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the rolls in half horizontally, place the bottom half on a baking sheet, and sprinkle with cheese.</li>
        <li>Stir together the chicken, hot sauce, ranch, and some of the ranch dressing mix.</li>
        <li>Spread the chicken mixture over the bottom half, then top with the remaining cheese.</li>
